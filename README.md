## Playing

TBD

## Building

Install node.js if you don't have it already.

Install the uglifyjs and http-server node.js packages:

`npm install uglify-js -g`
`npm install http-server -g`

To build the game, run the mkdist.sh shell command; it takes an optional --serve (or --server) argument which, if provided, will launch a `http-server` instance.  Open http://localhost:8080/ to play the game
